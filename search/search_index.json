So the whole discussion about who should the car kill in a fatal situation. Let me explain why.</p> <p>Yesterday I attended a conference about Ethics and AI, and the speaker mentioned the trolley dilemma. The question asked was \"What should the self-driving car do?\" and kind of forced us to take sides on the matter. </p> <ul> <li>Kill the passengers; </li> <li>Kill the pedestrians;</li> </ul> <p>This is the same as the trolley problem but one difference. AI don't have morals, it will follow what is programmed without any hesitation. So the question is not what the AI should do, but what the programmer codes it to do.</p> <p>Well, the whole premise on asking what should do \"kill this, or that\" is totally wrong. As a programmer myself, and knowing the limits of the system, I would never code a system to make such a decision. If the car is in a situation that it cannot break in time with the current limited vision, it should go slower. So no decision ever has to be made.</p> <p>Let's do some math for you to see how this could be easily solved.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2023/07/28/the-problem-with-ai-trolley-dilemma/#the-math","title":"The math","text":"<p>Let's use the standard formula for the distance needed to stop a car.</p> \\[S = v*t + \\frac{v^2}{2*u*g}\\] <p>Where:</p> <ul> <li>\\(S\\) is the distance needed to stop;</li> <li>\\(v\\) is the speed of the car;</li> <li>\\(t\\) is the reaction time;</li> <li>\\(v*t\\) is the distance traveled during the reaction time;</li> <li>\\(u\\) is the tire friction factor;</li> <li>\\(g\\) is the gravity acceleration;</li> <li>\\(\\frac{v^2}{2*u*g}\\) is the distance traveled during the breaking time;</li> </ul> <p>If the car is going at \\(100 km/h\\) (\\(27.7 m/s\\), \\(62.14 mi/h\\)) and the reaction time of the AI is relatively fast, let's say \\(0.2 s\\), so the distance traveled to a complete sage stop would be:</p> \\[S = 27.7 * 0.2 + \\frac{27.7^2}{2*0.2*9.8} = 5.54 + 38.5 = 44.04 m\\] <p>Which means that the car would need \\(44.04 m\\) to stop.

It restricts others from accessing or discussing your educational records without your consent. Here we are going to discuss how it applies to the courses I teach and what are the benefits on sharing your work publicly if you want.</p> <p>FERPA consent form</p> <p>Read more about the reasoning and rationale below.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>This a modified version from this original.</p> <p>In a typical class, your homework (and other information delineating your academic performance) would not be visible to the public. Indeed, the FERPA law requires that you have the right to privacy in this regard. This is one of the main reasons for the existence of so many \"walled gardens\" for courseware, such as Autolab, Blackboard, CanvasLMS and Piazza, which keep all student work hidden behind passwords.</p> <p>An essential component of the educational experience in new media arts, however, is learning how to participate in the \"Grand Conversation\" all around us, by becoming more effective culture operators. We cannot do this in the safe space of a Canvas module. Our work is strengthened and sharpened in the forge of public scrutiny: in this case, the agora of the Internet.</p> <p>Sometimes students are afraid to publish something because it is of poor quality. They think that they will receive embarrassing, negative critiques. In fact, negative critique is quite rare. The most common thing that happens when one creates an artwork of poor quality, is that it is simply ignored. Being ignored - this, not being shunned or derided - this is the fate of mediocre work.</p> <p>On the other hand, if something is truly great is published - and great projects can happen, and have happened, even in an introductory class like this one - there is the chance that it may be circulated widely on the Internet. Every year that I have taught, a handful of the students' projects get blogged and receive as many as 50000 views in a week. It cannot be emphasized that this can be an absolutely transformative experience for students, that cannot be obtained without taking the risk to work publicly. Students get jobs and build careers on the basis of such success.</p> <p>That said, there are also plenty of reasons why you may wish to work anonymously, when you work online. Perhaps you are concerned about stalkers or harassment. Perhaps you wish to address themes in your work which might not meet with the approval of your parents or future employers. These are valid considerations, in which case, we advise using an anonymous identity on Github. On our course repository, your work will be indexed by a public-facing name, generally your first name.

The most important ones are:</p> <ul> <li>Motion Sickness: the feeling of nausea and discomfort caused by the mismatch between the user's movements and the virtual world. It is mostly caused by:<ul> <li>Latency: the time it takes for the system to react to the user's actions. The system needs to process the inputs, accelerometers, gyroscopes, and other sensors, and then render the new image to the user. This process takes time and if it is too long the user will feel unresponsiveness and will get sick; </li> <li>Field of View: the area that the user can see at any given time doesnt match the area that the user can see in the real world;</li> <li>Resolution: the number of pixels that the user can see at any given time. Ex. The Oculus Rift DK1 had a resolution of 640x800 per eye that was zoomed to cover the user's entire field of view, and on top of that, the spacing between pixels makes the image looks like a grid of squared dots; you can see why it received so many complaints;</li> <li>Tracking: the ability of the system to track the user's movements properly. The sensors usually do not refresh at the same rate as the display, so the system needs to interpolate the user's movements between the sensor readings. This can cause the user to feel like the virtual world is lagging behind the real world and be out of sync with the user's movements;</li> </ul> </li> <li>Comfort: the feeling of comfort that the user has while using the system. If the device needs to be worn for a long period of time, right weight distribution, padding, and ventilation are important to make the user feel comfortable;</li> <li>Cost: the cost of the system. The machinery and technology used to create the system can be very expensive to be accessible to the general audience;</li> <li>Portability: the ability of the system to be used in different places. If the system is too heavy or too big it will be hard to carry; </li> <li>Social Acceptance: the acceptance of the system by the society. If the system is too intrusive or too weird it will be hard to use in public places. It could be seen as a threat to privacy or as a threat to the user's safety;</li> <li>Battery Life: the amount of time that the system can be used without being plugged in. If the system needs to be plugged in all the time it will be hard to use in public places;</li> <li>Software Development Kits: the tools that developers use to create applications for the system. If the SDK is too hard to use or too limited it will be hard to create applications for the system;</li> </ul> <p>I will add to this list a personal experience that I don't see many people talking about: bad smell, oily foams, and connectors corrosion. The root of those problems is the proximity with the user's face. The user's face is a very oily place and the foam that is used to make the device comfortable is an exceptional place for bacteria to grow. The connectors are also exposed to the user's sweat and can corrode over time and brick your device.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2023/08/09/lets-talk-about-virtual-reality/#applications","title":"Applications","text":"<p>There are virtually infinite applications for immersive technologies, but I will focus on the ones that I think are the most important ones in my opinion:</p> <ul> <li>Entertainment: Games in general, but also movies, etc.;</li> <li>Data Visualization: the ability to visualize data in a 3D space can be very useful to understand complex data;</li> <li>Education: Training, virtual classrooms, virtual museums, virtual tours, etc.;</li> <li>Social: Virtual meetings, parties, dating, etc.;</li> <li>Psychological Treatment: Virtual exposure therapy(Ex.: PTSD, phobias), virtual reality therapy, etc.;</li> <li>Medical: Surgery planning, surgery simulation, etc.;</li> <li>Design: Architecture, interior design, etc.; </li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/2023/08/09/lets-talk-about-virtual-reality/#future","title":"Future","text":"<p>In my past, I have created a startup to help surgeons plan their surgeries and ported it to VR - DocDo.

I felt it was a just a new interpretation of a product previously tested on Second Life and proved to be a niche product, focused in being fun, but forcing the use of device with many issues.

It is surprisingly easy to use, filled with useful functions, although it is buggy and crashes randomly in beta channel that I am using now. I think it is an exceptional example of how to create a nice SDK for a new platform. I am not sure if it will be a success, but I am sure that it will empower many developers to create new or port existing applications to their platform. They have created a simply way to bring a desktop experience to a VR gadget that just work. You can \"easily\" port your app to it and it will work. It is portable, easy to code, powerful hardware, nice battery life, and a nice SDK. I think it is a nice recipe for success.
